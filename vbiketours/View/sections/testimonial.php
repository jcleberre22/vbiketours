							<p>Saigon has nearly 5 million motorbikes and a 100,000 cars, all
								who are crazy and would be banned from driving in the UK. So its
								pretty scary just watching the traffic. My wife after much
								persuading agreed to go on the Vbiketour. And after 5 minutes
								she was elated and glad she did and felt totally safe. The girls
								who drive the motorbikes are the most friendly, excellent
								drivers and beautiful you could wish to meet and they speak
								great English. My wife mentioned it was my birthday and one of
								the girls bought me a cake with my name on it and a happy
								birthday hat. Totally unexpected and out of the blue. How about
								that! We did a lot of trips while in Vietnam but this motorbike
								tour of Saigon was definitely the best and most memorable. Just
								do it!</p>
